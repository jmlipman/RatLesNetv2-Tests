We provide the code used for running all the experiments of "RatLesNetv2: A Fully Convolutional Network for Rodent Brain Lesion Segmentation". Running this code requires modifying the files in the root folder.

If you want to simply use RatLesNetv2, we recommend you to download it from [RatLesNetv2 repository](https://github.com/jmlipman/RatLesNetv2)  because that code is easier to read, simplified, well-commented and it will be maintained.
